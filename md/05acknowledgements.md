This book has taken three years to complete, and has made me painfully
aware of my limitations as both an intellectual and as a writer. Trained
in political economy and historical sociology, I thought I had it clear
from the start. Yet the more I wrote, the more questions were raised by
the text, and the more unsure I was as to how to properly answer them. I
felt that my ignorance of philosophy, particularly queer theory and
critical theory, made (and still makes) this essay woefully incomplete.

Politically, my theory seems consistent with reformist, rather than
revolutionary, solutions to the present capitalist crisis, and this
stands at odds with my anti-capitalist beliefs as an activist. However,
the reformist way out of the Great Recession also seems fraught with
unknowns. The social regulation of capital, achieved under Fordism in
the past century is theoretically possible; yet what of its ecological
regulation? From Piketty’s law, we know that higher growth is needed to
reduce precarity and inequality, as well as curb the power of oligarchy.
But doesn’t this entail an acceleration in environmental destruction and
climate instability? Whilst capitalism can conceivably be reformed via
unconditional basic income, amongst other things, is carbon-neutral
capitalism possible?

In essence, the fight of the precariat against oligarchy must be both
expansionary and green. How to reconcile the egalitarian priority with
the ecological imperative? I wonder if I have dealt with this conundrum
satisfactorily in the final chapter.

From this conundrum arises the thorniest of issues: class. Is the
precariat its own class, or is it just the established working-class
under a new guise? It isn’t a section of the working-class, but is what
labor has become. If the 21st century precariat was the equivalent of
the 20th century proletariat, should it embrace communism as its
revolutionary ideology? The short answer to this is: no.

We need to shed communism and go beyond anarchism because they are
simply not working as anti-capitalist mass ideals. Much like what is
currently happening in Barcelona and Madrid, anarcho-populism and
eco-feminism must be fused into a left-populist project, and exported
everywhere the right-populist politics of Donald Trump and European
anti-immigration parties exist. I call this synthesis social populism.
Electoral movements such as Podemos in Spain, as well as Bernie Sanders’
campaign in the last American election, evidence the possibility of a
populist movement of this form. These are themselves germane to
anti-systemic movements as diverse as Indignados, Ni Una Menos,
Blockupy, UK Uncut, Sciopero Sociale, Nuit Debout, Notre Dame des
Landes, Fight for 15, Black Lives Matter, and Standing Rock, to cite
only some of the most significant movements of recent years.

The historical discontinuity of 2016 seemed to make all the chips of the
book fall into place. Finally, I had a historical antagonist to test my
theory against: nationalist populism. And finally, I had a publisher
egging me on to finish the damned thing: Geert Lovink and his Institute
of Network Cultures. I got an invitation to MoneyLab \#3 and was buzzed
by its mix of heretic theorizing on post-crisis capitalism. It’s the
Institute of Network Cultures which believed this work should be
published, and in doing so, has filled the intellectual void that I have
felt in my life since the anti-globalization movement ended in the late
2000s. I am forever grateful to Geert, Leonieke, and Max for putting
out, editing, and proofreading *General Theory of the Precariat*.

This work was also made possible by two earlier stages of writing, where
various sorts of people provided encouragement, as well as suggestions,
to various earlier drafts. In 2014, literary scout Kelly Farber and
literary agent Alex Jacobs, two professionals of the New York publishing
industry, first believed in this book. They hoped I could get a contract
from a U.S. publisher, but the thinking and writing in my proposal was
shoddy, in spite of Alex’s insightful editorial corrections.

Then in 2015, Marc Monaco and my forever-buddies-in-precarious-struggle
in Liège revived the project. Together with feminist activist Emilie
Rouchon, bookseller Olivier Verschueren, and his wife, professor
Florence Caeymaex, they even tried to set up a publishing house, Pidgin,
in order to release my work in both French and English. A heartfelt
thanks to all of you, including Eric, Cédric, Marie, and Slim, for this
book wouldn’t exist without you. Equally important was the intellectual
sustenance provided by the Net-Time mailing list, where the sharp minds
of those such as Brian Holmes, Felix Stadler, and Keith Hart, always
gave me food for thought. I also wish to thank Andrea ‘Marvin’ Tumietto
for his enduring complicity from ChainWorkers until now, Giuseppe
‘Peppe’ Allegri for generously sharing his culture and knowledge on
Europe and the precariat, and Michael Reinsborough for expanding my
political horizons from Belfast to London and beyond. Finally, I owe to
my friendship with sociologist Paolo Gerbaudo the interpretation of the
2011 revolution and contemporary populism. I strongly recommend you read
his latest book, *The Mask and the Flag*, as well any of his future
publications.

A sweet thought to my friends in the Comasina hood of Northern Milan:
Paolino and Silvano. Unwavering solidarity to the two Milanese social
centers that are in my heart: ZAM and Lambretta. A big thank you to the
thinkers that have inspired me since I was a teen, Toni Negri and Bifo.
A great hug to all those who have been involved in EuroMayDay, in
particular Javier Toret, Marcelo Expósito, Vanni Brusadin, Joshua
Eichen, Nikolaj Heltoft, Miika Saukkonen, Josip Rotar, Olle Larsson, Ben
Trott, Kaz Sakurada, and warm feelings to the San Precario people, many
of whom I have parted ways with, for leftist politics is inherently
divisive and I am disputatious by nature. A special mention goes to San
Precario’s co-inventor Stefo Mansi, a great friend and Milan’s best
union organizer of precarious workers.

Finally, I’d like to thank my lover Eli, my teen daughter Selma and my
baby son Rocco for giving me every day a reason to live.
