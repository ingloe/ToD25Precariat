The ultimate reason for all real crises always remains the poverty and
restricted consumption of the masses.

Karl Marx, *Das Kapital*

When the rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of growth of output
and income, as it did in the nineteenth century and seems quite likely
to do again in the twenty-first, capitalism automatically generates
arbitrary and unsustainable inequalities that radically undermine the
meritocratic values on which democratic societies are based.

These systems are failing.
